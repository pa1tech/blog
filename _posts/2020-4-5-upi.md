Ever wondered what you would get when you decode a UPI QR code. This article is all about that so that you can create your own QR to receive payments and will also guide you to make a webpage to receive UPI payments.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1_upi_logo.png" /></div>
<br/>

Suppose you want to receive a payment from someone, you can just share this link with a specified amount to them which will redirect them to a UPI app. So let's begin the show :)

## UPI QR
Once when I decoded a UPI QR using some tool online, this is what I got -

> upi://pay?pa=somevpa@somebank&pn=My%20Name&tn=yourtext&am=200&cu=INR

So using this we can make QR's ourselves by embedding this text into them. Apart from this, there is something more interesting to observe in the embedding. It resembles a web URL, something like - <i>https://pa1tech.github.io/blog/?t=100 </i> with payee VPA, name, message, and the amount being the URL variables.

## Making your UPI payment link

Since it resembles a URL, what happens if we browse it?

It actually works!. Google Chrome and other browsers have become smart to identify UPI URLs and redirect us to UPI app when we browse them.

So, here is [my Github repo](https://github.com/pa1tech/upi), where I created a very simple webpage which takes UPI id and amount as URL variables and redirects you to UPI app on your phone, else if you browse it on your laptop/PC, it shows a QR which can be scanned on any UPI app to make make the payment. Take a look at the [index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pa1tech/upi/master/index.html) file, its self-explantory front-end stuff. I used a javascript plugin to render QR online. This feature is live @ 

> https://pa1tech.github.io/upi/?\<upi\_id\>&\<amt\>

For example, [https://pa1tech.github.io/upi/?pmcares@sbi&116](https://pa1tech.github.io/upi/?pmcares@sbi&116)

Note: This webpage is purely a frontend site and doesn't store any of your info. Github provides free hosting for static sites. How cool is it have a website for yourself! Do try it.

### !ncred UPI Pay
[@incred_upibot](https://telegram.me/incred_upibot) is my Telegram bot which helps you to create UPI payment links and QRs, which you can share with your friends to receive money. Supports inline usage as well for personal chats, groups and channels.

<b>Update(May 2021):</b> <i>UPI has got a new security feature of blcoking payments initiated from unknown sources/unauthorized merchants.</i> But the hack for making custom QR's still works. It is very likely that this hack also reaches end of life in future updates :(
