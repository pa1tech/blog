[India Post](https://www.indiapost.gov.in) is one of the largest postal services network in the world by GoI. We all should be proud of it, be aware of the services provided, and utilize them. Even in this digital era, the need for mailing and courier services is significantly prevailing for authenticity and maintaining records.

There has always been a wrong perception of the reliability of the services offered by India Post for the reason it being a public sector organization. But things have changed and India Post has developed a lot and is striving to keep its services on par with the private companies. 

For example, the courier service(letter in an envelope) offered by private companies is equivalent to India Post's [Speed Post](https://www.indiapost.gov.in/MBE/Pages/Content/Speed-Post.aspx). It is much cheaper (around 50/-, depends on distance and weight) and as reliable as any private courier service. It also comes with online tracking service too. What more do you want!

Apart from mailing services, India Post also provides a wide range of banking and insurance services. You might think that when public sector banks are already there, what is the need for India Post to offer these services. Though banking services have become widely available and essential for everyone today, in olden days, especially in rural areas, accessibility to banking services was very less. Since postal services were more accessible, its banking services had significant demand.

India Post is the first organization in India to introduce the Public Provident Fund (PPF) Scheme. Later public sector banks started it as well.
A few years back, India Post has also started its digital banking initiative, [India Post Payments Bank (IPPB)](https://www.ippbonline.com)


## Inland Letter Card

Let's come to the main content of this blog i.e, Inland Letter Card. Have you ever received notices from a bank or a share broking enterprise which is just a single A4 sheet folded and pasted, having content on one side and address printed on the outer side? This is what is called Inland Letter Card. Take a look at this [file image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0111/6667/9098/products/10923_800x.jpg).

I was quite excited by this service as you don't need to buy a separate envelope to mail the letter. You can casually print your content/message on one side and print the address on the other side and mail it. It is as simple as that. 

It is also quite cheap, just <b>Rs.2.50/- </b>. You can buy stamps from your nearest post office in any denomination and paste it on your letter. You can read more about the Inland Letter Card [here](https://www.indiapost.gov.in/MBE/Pages/Content/Inland-Letter-Card.aspx).

I have made a [template](https://pa1tech.github.io/blog/InlandLetterCard.pdf) for an A4 sheet which can be mailed as an inland letter card.

Maybe you can mail your friends and relatives with your greetings on special occasions or festivals, it definitely would mean something to them :)
